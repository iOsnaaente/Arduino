# Projetos em Arduino

´Repositório para projetos desenvolvidos em Arduino.´

The first project here was a RF protocol to communicate two arduinos (1 UNO and 1 Nano) with a module called MX-RM-5V (a receiver and a transmiter). The communicate was made using the concepts aborded in Industrial Networks classrom.

In Industrial Networks was learned concepts of transmission using the protocol ASK (Amplitude shift Keying) and OOK (On Off Keying) being the main protocol used by this process. 

The first step to turn this project alive was the creation of a CRC system of byte counting, to make the transmission more security.
